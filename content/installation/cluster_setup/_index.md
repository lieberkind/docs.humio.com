This section describes how to install Humio configured as a distributed system across multiple machines.

Please make sure you ended up here on this page, for one of the following reasons

* You want to verify that Humio actually does clustering
* Your current Humio instance is running out of resources

Clustering is very hard and we usually don't recommend running your proof-of-concept on a cluster. You will be surprised
 by the amount of data Humio can handle on a single node setup. As a general rule of thumb a decent sized developer 
 laptop can ingest around 100s GB/day

<!--TODO: We offer two types of installations -->
